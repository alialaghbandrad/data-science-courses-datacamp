# Question 01

## Sorting data sources

Data collection is the first step in the data science workflow. Without data, there wouldn't be any data science. Depending on the project you are working on, you will need different data sources. Consider the following data needs.

Is this data publicly available, or something that is tracked by companies internally?

Select the data source type that is most appropriate for each need.

* Company Data:
- Number of people clicking on the Coming Soon link on a company website.
- The number of customers that bought an iPhone in London in December this year.
- How likely an Airbnb user is to recommend the website to a friend or colleague.

* Open Data:
- Average household income in Miami-Dade County
- Number of women between the ages of 30 - 45 living in Miami-Dade County
- Stock prices of different beauty brands over time
