# Question 03

## Classifying data types

It's important to know what type of data you have collected. This will be important later on in the data science workflow, when you want to store the data and even later when you will be performing the analyses.

There are two types of data: qualitative data and quantitative data.

Classify the data as the correct data type.

* Quantitative Data:
- The daily average temperature in New York during 2019
- The individual weight of all the dogs in a shelter
- The price of a cup of coffee in Parisian caf√©s

* Qualitative Data:
- Images of several cats
- The reviews for a property on Airbnb
- The eye color of people participating in a study
